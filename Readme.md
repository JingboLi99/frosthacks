# Colour Match üì±

Colour Match is a minimalistic endless runner game that is developed for mobile devices using the Android OS. We were inspired by the popularity of endless runner games like Flappy bird, Crossy Road and Colour Switch and wanted to do something similar.

## How to install üîß
We have long term plans of deploying the app onto the Google Play Store after improving the UI. However, currently it is only available if you clone our open-sourced repository here and then run the ```main.dart``` file as the entry point to our program.

## How to play ‚ùì 

We did not add a tutorial because we felt that the interface of the game is intuitive enough on its own. The player controls the colour of a box using a combination of 3 coloured buttons at the bottom of the screen. Coloured wall obstacles are rapidly spawned and the user has to toggle the buttons in order to match his box with the colour of the incoming wall. Careful! Walls move faster and appear more frequently as your score increases.

## Tech Stack Ô∏è‚öôÔ∏è

Colour Match was developed using the dart programming language and  the following frameworks:

- Flutter - Popular frontend framework for mobile app development
- Flame - One of the best documented mobile game engines for Flutter

## Reflection üè´

Most of us are programming beginners and this is the first time we have participated in a Hackathon. We wanted to challenge ourselves by completing a mobile game using a framework that required us to code. We are very proud with what we have accomplished over the weekend and we defintely learnt alot more about game development.
